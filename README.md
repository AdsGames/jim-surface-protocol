## Gameplay

Your goal is to purify the map using trees and water purifiers. As you progress, so will the environment around you.

## Walkthrough

Start by drilling a few crates or dead trees to gather biomass.

Once you have collected 10 units of biomass, you can build a sapling. After some time the sapling will grow into a tree which purifies nearby soil and grass.

Junk drops scrap which can be used to upgrade move/drill speed.

Once you have accumulated enough biomass, you can place purifiers on the toxic water.

Enjoy and try to purify the whole world!
